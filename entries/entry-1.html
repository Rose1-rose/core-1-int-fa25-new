    <h2> Subway Roar</h2>
    <p>
      The 14th Street–Union Square station hums like a living instrument. It’s not just the trains—
      it’s the rhythm of footsteps, the shuffle of commuters, the metallic pulse of the city itself.
      The roar of the incoming train echoes off the tiled walls, followed by the sudden hush that
      falls when the doors slide open. The smell of metal and dust hangs in the air, but somewhere
      in that noise, music blooms.
    <p>
      Near the downtown platform, a saxophonist stands beneath the fluorescent lights. His case is
      open, lined with a few crumpled dollar bills. The first note he plays cuts through the chaos—
      warm, soulful, trembling at the edges. It bends around the column, finds its way between
      conversations, and lingers above the heads of people waiting for the next train. Some listen.
      Most don’t. But for a few moments, the space changes shape. The usual impatience softens into
      something almost tender.

      A woman in a long coat taps her foot. A man in a suit lowers his phone to look up. Even the
      pigeons perched near the tracks seem to pause. The music rises, fills the station, then fades
      as another train arrives, swallowing the melody in its thunder. When it’s gone, there’s a
      small silence, the kind that makes you suddenly aware of your own breathing. The musician
      takes a breath, adjusts his reed, and begins again.
      </p>

      Union Square is one of those places where you can hear the city think—voices, trains,
      announcements, laughter, and above it all, the persistence of a song that refuses to be lost.
      It’s a reminder that in New York, even underground, there is always someone creating, always
      someone playing against the noise.

      <h2>My Auditory diary</h2>
    <p>
    I still remember the first time I stopped to really listen at Union Square.
    It was winter — the kind of cold that hums in the concrete. The trains came and went
    like tides, but between them, there was a strange silence, heavy and soft.
  </p>
  <p>
    Somewhere on the downtown platform, a saxophone began to breathe.
    The first note wasn’t perfect — it cracked a little, like a door half-open —
    but it carried warmth that didn’t belong to the underground. I could feel it move
    through the tiled walls, winding between strangers, echoing off metal and memory.
  </p>
  <p>
    I leaned against the pillar and closed my eyes. The footsteps around me blurred
    into a kind of rhythm, the low air vents whispered like a second melody.
    For a few minutes, I wasn’t in transit; I was inside the sound itself —
    wrapped in brass and echo and human breath.
  </p>
  <p>
    When the next train came, the song dissolved into its roar, and the moment folded
    back into the city’s noise. But sometimes, even now, when a train passes under the
    street at night, I swear I still hear that same note — trembling, defiant, alive.
