          The path along the reservoir is soft with petals. Not just on the branches —
          the branches are already exploding, pale pink against a cold blue sky — but underfoot,
          floating in shallow puddles, caught on jacket sleeves, tangled in people’s hair.
          Everyone walking slows down here. Nobody says “excuse me” or “keep moving.”
          It’s like the whole park quietly agrees to move in half-speed.
        </p>

        <p>
          The sound is gentle, but not quiet.
          There’s wind pushing through the blossoms, and it’s not the rustle of summer leaves,
          it’s drier, lighter, almost papery. Every gust makes thousands of petals lift at once
          and the air actually reacts — tiny gasps, soft laughs, phones being raised.
          You can hear that moment when people decide this is the photo.
        </p>

        <p>
          On the bench near the curve of the water, two older women are talking in Japanese,
          murmuring and then cracking up, the kind of laugh where you lean forward and cover your mouth.
          A couple nearby is switching between Spanish and English, arguing playfully
          about which tree is better. Further down, a kid in a puffy jacket is yelling
          “It’s snowing! It’s snowing!” and his dad goes, “Cherry snow, buddy,”
          like this is a real weather event that happens every year.
        </p>

        <p>
          Runners still cut through the path, headphones in, steady shoes on pavement:
          thup-thup-thup. They don’t stop, but they do look up. Just for a second.
          You can hear when they glance up — their breathing pattern shifts,
          like they’re between work and something softer.
        </p>

        <p>
          When the breeze picks up, petals come down in sheets, landing on the surface of the reservoir.
          The water taps very quietly against the stone edge, and for a second it’s the loudest thing
          because everyone else around you has gone still. The city doesn’t stop — you can still hear
          a siren somewhere on the east side, and the low, constant traffic hum out past the trees —
          but here it’s filtered. Softer. As if Central Park isn’t inside New York,
          but New York is happening outside of it.

          Central Park sounded softer today — like the whole city had taken a breath and exhaled in petals.
          The usual chatter of footsteps and traffic was still there, but blurred, as if wrapped in silk.
          I stood under the cherry trees, and the wind kept starting small conversations I couldn’t quite translate.
        </p>

        <p>
          When a gust passed through, the blossoms rustled like fabric brushing skin — not loud, but close.
          The petals fell in clusters, tapping against sleeves, strollers, the rim of a paper cup.
          Every sound was delicate, but layered; even the smallest one seemed to echo longer than it should.
        </p>

        <p>
          Somewhere behind me, someone was playing a guitar — just a few uncertain chords, drifting in and out of tune.
          Birds picked up the spaces he left, filling them with quick, silver notes.
          I realized the park was improvising, the way people do when they’re trying not to disturb beauty.
        </p>

        <p>
          For a while, I stopped taking photos.
          The sound itself felt enough — a hush that wasn’t silence, a melody that wasn’t meant to last.
          When I finally walked away, the blossoms were still falling, but slower,
          as if waiting for the next listener to arrive.
