    <h2>Entry 2: Café conversations</h2>
    <p>
      Late morning sunlight spills through the windows of a small café on a quiet corner in the West Village. 
      The space hums softly with overlapping voices, the kind that fill a room without ever becoming noise. 
      The hiss of the espresso machine punctuates the air like a steady heartbeat, followed by the click of ceramic cups 
      set down on wooden tables. Every sound feels close, tangible — the rhythm of people slowing down.

      Near the window, a barista hums along with the low jazz track playing from a tiny speaker. 
      Two friends sit across from each other, their laughter rising and falling between sips of cappuccino. 
      A student leans over a laptop, typing in bursts, then pausing to stir sugar into her coffee. 
      The café door opens and closes again and again, each time bringing a gust of cool air and the faint scent of the city outside — 
      rain, asphalt, and roasted beans blending together.

      The soundtrack here is gentle but layered: milk frothing, pages turning, a spoon clinking against glass, 
      the quiet sigh of someone thinking. 
      These small, almost invisible sounds form a kind of harmony — a reminder that even in a restless city, 
      peace doesn’t have to mean silence. 
      It can exist in the in-between, in the pause before another conversation begins.

      From the outside, the café looks ordinary, just another place on another New York block. 
      But when you listen closely, you realize it holds a rhythm of its own — a small composition of voices, 
      movement, and time slowing down. 
      In this corner of the city, sound becomes warmth, and noise becomes music.
