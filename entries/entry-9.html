          The museum feels both open and contained. In the glass atrium, the sound of footsteps softens as it spreads across the floor, then returns as a faint echo off the high windows. The reflecting pool folds the room in half—light above, water below. People sit along its edge, whispering, or not talking at all. The air hums with the quietest possible kind of conversation.
        </p>

        <p>
          A single cough travels across the hall. Somewhere, a page turns; a coat sleeve brushes stone. Every small sound lands cleanly, surrounded by space. The glass above hums faintly from outside wind. It’s hard to tell where the sound ends and where the air begins.
        </p>

        <p>
          When someone stands up, the movement ripples through the benches like a signal. The water trembles, catches light, then stills again. The entire room seems to breathe in one slow rhythm, shared by everyone without agreement.

          In the sculpture wing, sound has weight. It gathers near the marble, bounces from one figure to the next, and lingers in the air like breath that never quite leaves. Shoes scuff against the floor, careful but not silent. The walls feel close, but not heavy.
        </p>

        <p>
          I stopped in front of a statue and listened. The air around it was colder, sharper. You could almost hear the space holding still. Somewhere behind me, a guard’s radio murmured, then clicked off. The sound of stillness felt clearer after that.
        </p>

        <p>
          I didn’t speak, but it felt like I had. The room already knew what I meant.
