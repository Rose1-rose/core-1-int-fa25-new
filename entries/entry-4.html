      </header>

      <div class="entry-body">
        <p>
          Morning in Chinatown begins long before the rest of the city is fully awake.
          The streets near Canal and Mott are alive with sound — the clatter of metal shutters rolling open,
          the splash of water as vendors rinse their stalls, the soft thud of crates set down on wet pavement.
          Voices fill the air in bursts: greetings, bargaining, laughter, and the rhythmic shuffle of carts
          moving along the curb.
        </p>
     
        <p>
          Every corner has its own music. A fishmonger calls out the day’s catch,
          his voice rising above the hum of conversation.
          Plastic bags rustle as customers pick through bunches of choy sum and cilantro,
          the smell of ginger and scallions sharp in the damp morning air.
          Somewhere behind the produce stands, a cleaver strikes the chopping board in a steady, confident rhythm —
          part percussion, part heartbeat.
        </p>

        <p>
          The languages overlap like melodies — Cantonese, Mandarin, English, and something else in between,
          the language of familiarity. Elderly shoppers exchange quick words about prices and recipes;
          tourists pass through, slower, curious, holding phones out to take photos.
          For a moment, everyone shares the same narrow street, moving to the same unspoken tempo.
        </p>

        <p>
          As sunlight climbs over the buildings, the market grows louder, brighter, more awake.
          Delivery trucks back up with a sharp beep-beep, steam rises from breakfast stalls selling baozi and soy milk,
          the air filling with warmth and salt and sweet dough.

          The morning market never asks for attention — it simply surrounds you.
          Sounds stack on top of one another until they stop being separate:
          the slap of fish against ice, the quick slice of a cleaver,
          the rising hiss of steam from a breakfast stall.
          Every note has a purpose, and together they make a rhythm that feels older than the city itself.
        </p>

        <p>
          I stood near a vegetable stand, pretending to choose greens, but really just listening.
          Plastic bags snapped open like tiny cymbals.
          Somewhere nearby, a radio was playing an old Cantopop song that no one was really hearing —
          yet the melody threaded through everything, binding the chaos into something almost gentle.
        </p>

        <p>
          The languages blended into a single current.
          Cantonese folded into English, Mandarin into laughter,
          and even silence carried weight — the moment before a price is agreed upon,
          the inhale before another shout across the street.
          I realized the market breathes like a body: inhale, exhale, sell, repeat.
        </p>

        <p>
          When I finally left, my hands smelled faintly of scallion and metal coins.
          The noise faded behind me, but the rhythm stayed —
          a reminder that even in the busiest corners of the city,
          listening can still be an act of stillness.
