    <h2>Entry 3: Riverside Breeze — Williamsburg</h2>
    <p>
      The edge of Williamsburg hums with a softer kind of rhythm. Down by the East River, 
      the city’s roar feels distant, like a memory carried on the wind. 
      The park stretches open toward Manhattan’s skyline, a mix of green and rusted steel, 
      where joggers pass by cyclists, and couples sit cross-legged on the grass facing the water. 
      The soundscape here is gentle but full: footsteps on the boardwalk, dogs shaking off river spray, 
      laughter drifting between conversations.

      The wind moves through the park like a musician, brushing across the reeds, 
      rattling the metal railings, carrying fragments of a street guitarist’s melody from the next bench over. 
      Somewhere upriver, a ferry cuts through the water, its low engine rumble mixing with the faint clang 
      of a construction site across the way. Overhead, the J train rolls across the Williamsburg Bridge, 
      its echo dissolving into the open sky.

      The air smells faintly of salt and roasted coffee from the shops nearby. 
      A child’s kite flickers against the skyline, its tail snapping in the wind. 
      Conversations here happen in many languages — English, Spanish, laughter, silence — 
      all weaving into a slow, unhurried rhythm. 
      The city is still present, but softer, less demanding, as if it’s pausing to breathe.

      As the sun begins to lower, the light turns gold against the river, 
      catching the glass of Manhattan’s towers in reflections that shimmer and break with the waves. 
      Someone plays music from a portable speaker — a lo-fi beat, soft and imperfect — 
      and for a moment, everything feels in tune. 
      The sound of the wind, the water, the people, and the city — 
      all blending together, forming a quiet harmony that belongs to Williamsburg alone.
