          By late November, the air in Cold Spring starts to sharpen, but some trees still haven’t let go. Their leaves, dark bronze and slightly curled, cling to the thin branches like an unfinished thought. Walking along the river, the wind carries a colder tone. Leaves lift and rattle softly against each other — not the lush rustle of summer, but something drier, lighter, almost like paper brushing paper. Every gust shakes a few loose, and they drift down slowly, spinning before landing.

          At the edge of the water, a buoy knocks a hollow rhythm. The river answers with a faint slap against stone. From up the hill, church bells mark the hour; further out, the train brakes squeal, doors beep, then fade into the long, steady pull as it leaves town. The place isn’t silent — it’s just slower, like every sound is taking its time.
        </p>

          Main Street is quiet. A few hikers return from Breakneck, boots heavy with mud, voices low. Someone twists open a thermos lid in front of a café. A dog shakes once and a tag chimes. The air smells faintly of coffee, cold iron, and fallen leaves. Everything feels suspended, like the town itself is waiting for winter to begin.
        </p>

        <p>
          The wind picks up again. Leaves scatter across the road, scrape against parked cars, and gather in corners. From the river, the sound carries further now — thinner, sharper, almost metallic. The last light hits the water in narrow strips, flashing like something being folded away. For a moment, it feels like the season is practicing how to disappear.

          Cold Spring sounded slower today. The wind had that late-season tone — not harsh, just thinner. Leaves scraped along the sidewalk, hitting against metal poles and boots. At the dock, the river made a low, steady sound, as if repeating a phrase it’s been saying all year.
        </p>

        <p>
          From the hill, church bells echoed between the buildings. Somewhere behind me, a train’s brakes hissed and released. The air carried that mix of water, stone, and smoke from someone’s chimney. I stood still for a while, listening to how the town exhaled.
        </p>

        <p>
          Every sound felt stretched — wind against leaves, footsteps on gravel, a door closing half a street away. It wasn’t empty, just unhurried. Like the trees, everything was taking a little longer to let go.
